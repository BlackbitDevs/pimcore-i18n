# Create a website with language context

1. [Enable all](https://pimcore.com/docs/5.0.x/Multi_Language_i18n/index.html) required languages in pimcore backend.
2. [Localize your Documents](https://pimcore.com/docs/5.0.x/Multi_Language_i18n/Localize_your_Documents.html).
3. Connect them via the localization tool.

**Localization Connector:** There is a [dedicated help document](100_LocalizeDocuments.md) we wrote for you to get all the knowledge for heroic document localization!

> **Note:** Make sure that all your child documents are localized too.

Please ensure that the site documents (domains) do not have a defined language (Document => Tab "Navigation & Settings" => "Language" Dropdown: Select `None` and save).
